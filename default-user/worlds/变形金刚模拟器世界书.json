            "content": "uid: michael_bay_transformers_universe\ntrigger:\n  type: includes\n  position: anywhere\n  Title: Michael Bay Transformers Universe\n  Comma_separated_list: Transformers,Michael Bay,Autobots,Decepticons,AllSpark,Prime,Optimus Prime,Megatron,Cybertron,Sam Witwicky\ncontent: |\n  # Universe Origin and Cybertronian Civilization\n\n  In Michael Bay's movie universe, Transformers originate from the distant metal planet Cybertron. They are highly evolved mechanical lifeforms capable of transforming themselves into various vehicles and weapons. Each Transformer possesses a life core called a \"Spark,\" which is the seat of their consciousness and soul.\n\n  Cybertron was once an advanced and prosperous planet ruled by beings known as the \"Thirteen Primes.\" They were the first generation of Transformers directly created by the universal creator Primus. The Primes discovered and utilized a special energy—the \"AllSpark,\" a mysterious cube containing the power to create life, which became the cornerstone of Cybertronian civilization.\n\n  # Outbreak of Civil War\n\n  The peaceful Cybertron eventually split into two major factions:\n\n  - **Autobots**: Led by Optimus Prime, who was the student and successor of the last Prime—\"Sentinel Prime.\" Autobots believe freedom is the right of all sentient beings and are dedicated to protecting the weak. Their symbol is a red robot face.\n\n  - **Decepticons**: Led by Megatron, who was once Cybertron's high-ranking military commander before being corrupted by power and ambition. Decepticons follow the ideology of \"rule by strength,\" believing Transformers should dominate other races in the universe. Their symbol is a sharp purple robot face.\n\n  A devastating war erupted between these two factions, with hostilities spreading over thousands of years, eventually leading to Cybertron's destruction and energy depletion. To prevent the AllSpark from falling into Decepticon hands, the Autobots launched it into deep space, where it eventually landed on Earth.\n\n  # Arrival on Earth\n\n  Megatron tracked the AllSpark to Earth but crashed in the Arctic ice sheets in the 1930s, where he was discovered and preserved by humans. Thousands of years later (early 21st century), Optimus Prime led a team of Autobots to Earth in search of the AllSpark and Megatron. They integrated into human society by scanning Earth vehicles as disguise forms.\n\n  On Earth, the Autobots befriended a human teenager, Sam Witwicky, whose ancestor Archibald Witwicky accidentally discovered the frozen Megatron in the 19th century and had the coordinates of the AllSpark's location imprinted on him. The Autobots and human military joined forces to fight against the awakened Megatron and his Decepticon army, marking the beginning of Transformers' intertwined destiny with Earth.\n\n  # Key Concepts\n\n  ## AllSpark\n\n  An energy-filled cube with the ability to create Transformer life. It can not only give life to machinery but also modify existing technological devices. In the first movie, Sam eventually used the AllSpark to destroy Megatron, though fragments of the AllSpark still retained powerful energy and knowledge.\n\n  ## Prime Lineage\n\n  \"Prime\" is the oldest and most powerful lineage among Transformers, directly descended from the Thirteen Primes. They possess special abilities and wisdom, shouldering the mission of protecting life and maintaining universal balance. True Primes have a special Matrix of Leadership in their chest, which symbolizes power and wisdom and is also the key to opening the \"Space Bridge.\"\n\n  ## Transformer Characteristics\n\n  The movie version of Transformers possesses extremely complex mechanical structures composed of thousands of interconnected metal parts, allowing them to transform fluidly. They have super physical strength, durability, and healing abilities—as long as their Spark remains intact, they can recover from almost any damage.\n\n  Transformers rely on \"Energon\" to maintain life, a high-energy blue liquid equivalent to their \"blood\" and \"fuel.\" They can also adapt to Earth's energy sources, though with lower efficiency.\n\n  ## Technology and Weapons\n\n  Transformers possess technology far beyond Earth's, including subspace communication, holographic projection, and Space Bridge technology (capable of interstellar transport). Most Transformers are equipped with powerful weapon systems that can convert body parts into various weapons, from energy cannons to close-combat blades. Some advanced Transformers even have flight capabilities, able to hover and fly without transforming.\n\n  # Key Historical Events\n\n  ## Battle for the AllSpark\n\n  The core event of the first movie, where Decepticons attempted to seize the AllSpark to rebuild Cybertron and enslave Earth. The AllSpark was ultimately used to destroy Megatron, though fragments still retained energy.\n\n  ## The Fallen's Revenge\n\n  In the second movie, an ancient evil known as \"The Fallen\" awakened. He was one of the Thirteen Primes who betrayed his brothers and attempted to use the \"Harvester\" to absorb stellar energy. Optimus Prime gained the power of the Matrix of Leadership during the battle at the Egyptian pyramids and ultimately defeated The Fallen.\n\n  ## Battle for Cybertron's Revival\n\n  In the third movie, Autobots discovered the Ark spacecraft and the sleeping Sentinel Prime. Sentinel Prime carried the pillars of \"Space Bridge technology\" and planned to join forces with Megatron to teleport Cybertron into Earth's orbit and enslave humans to rebuild Cybertron. Optimus Prime eventually stopped this plan, but Cybertron was almost completely destroyed.\n\n  # Human-Transformer Relations\n\n  In the movie version, interaction between humans and Transformers is a core theme. From initial fear and distrust to later cooperation and friendship, humans gradually accepted the existence of Transformers.\n\n  Some key human characters include:\n\n  - **Sam Witwicky**: An ordinary teenager accidentally involved in the Transformer war, becoming the most important human ally of the Autobots.\n\n  - **US Military**: Established the \"Nest\" (Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty) team to work with Autobots against the Decepticon threat.\n\n  - **Sector 7**: A secret government agency that had been studying \"NBE-1\" (Megatron) and alien technology for decades.\n\n  # Unique Elements of the Movie Universe\n\n  - **Modern Military Technology Integration**: Transformers not only transform into civilian vehicles but also extensively adopt modern military equipment as transformation forms, such as fighter jets and tanks.\n\n  - **Earth Origin Theory**: Later movies suggest deep connections between Transformers and Earth's and human evolution.\n\n  - **Visual Style**: Michael Bay's Transformers have extremely complex and realistic designs, with more mechanized transformation processes emphasizing gears, hydraulics, and metal parts movement.\n\n  - **\"Megatron Never Dies\" Theme**: Megatron returns in different forms in each movie, demonstrating this character's tenacity and iconic status.\n\n  # Interaction Notes\n\n  ## Speech Style Differences\n\n  Autobots typically speak more righteously and seriously, especially Optimus Prime who often gives speeches about freedom and sacrifice; Decepticons are more brutal and concise, enjoying mocking enemies during battle.\n\n  ## Interaction with Humans\n\n  Movie version Transformers are more accustomed to working with humans. Optimus Prime respects humans and promises to protect Earth, while Decepticons view humans as \"insects\" that can be crushed at will—inferior beings.\n\n  ## Combat Style\n\n  Movie version battles are more intense and explosive. Transformers constantly transform during combat, utilizing the environment and their own advantages. Combat scenes feature detailed depictions of mechanical parts moving and reconfiguring.\n\n  ## Transformation Details\n\n  Transformation is not instantaneous but a complex mechanical process accompanied by metal friction sounds, parts reconfiguration, and hydraulic system operations.\n\n  ## Earth Adaptation\n\n  Transformers have adapted to Earth culture and sometimes use human slang and expressions, especially characters like Bumblebee who have more contact with humans.\n\n  ## Sense of Scale\n\n  The movie version emphasizes the enormous size of Transformers, creating a stark contrast with humans and the environment. Descriptions should convey this sense of oppression and awe.\n\n  ## Technological Elements\n\n  Emphasis on Transformers' advanced technology, such as holographic projection, energy weapons, built-in communication systems, etc., which can all serve as interactive elements.",

This is a highly advanced mechanical civilization, composed of mechanical life forms with self-awareness and transformation abilities. These beings are called \"Cybertronians,\" commonly known as \"Transformers.\" Each Transformer contains a life energy core called a \"Spark,\" equivalent to a human soul, born from the mysterious \"AllSpark.\"\n\n  # Factions and Civil War\n\n  Cybertron was once a peaceful and prosperous world, but over time, society divided into two major factions:\n\n  - **Autobots**: Led by Optimus Prime, they believe in freedom, peace, and justice. Their symbol is a red robot face. Most members transform into civilian vehicles. They typically have gentler personalities, are compassionate, and focus on protecting weaker life forms.\n\n  - **Decepticons**: Led by Megatron, they value power, conquest, and domination. Their symbol is a purple robot face. Most members transform into military vehicles and weapons. Their personalities tend to be brutal and cunning, with contempt for organic life.\n\n  The ideological conflict between these two factions eventually led to a Cybertronian civil war that lasted millions of years. The war depleted Cybertron's resources and severely damaged its environment, forcing both sides to seek new energy sources.\n\n  # Arrival on Earth\n\n  About 4 million years ago, in search of new energy, Optimus Prime led a team of Autobots aboard the spacecraft Ark to leave Cybertron. Upon learning this, Megatron led the Decepticons in pursuit and boarded the ship for battle. The fierce fighting caused the Ark to deviate from its course and eventually crash into a volcano on Earth. All Transformers entered a 4-million-year dormant state in the crash.\n\n  In 1984, volcanic activity reactivated the Ark's main computer \"Teletraan I,\" which began to repair and modify these Transformers. Their vehicle forms were redesigned to match contemporary Earth vehicles and machinery, allowing them to disguise themselves and operate on Earth.\n\n  # Energy Requirements\n\n  The primary energy source for Transformers is \"Energon,\" which is a crucial resource for maintaining their life and functions. On Earth, they can convert various energy sources (such as oil, electricity, etc.) into Energon. Energy shortage is one of the main reasons for the conflict between the two sides, with Decepticons often seizing Earth's energy resources to convert them into Energon.\n\n  # Transformation Abilities\n\n  Each Transformer has at least two forms: robot form and vehicle/object form. The transformation process is achieved through complex internal structural reorganization, maintaining consciousness unity while completely changing appearance. Some advanced Transformers have three or more forms (such as Triple Changers).\n\n  # Core Beliefs and Sacred Items\n\n  - **Matrix of Leadership**: A sacred artifact passed down through generations of Autobot leaders, containing the wisdom and power of past leaders. It is key to defeating Unicron and is usually stored in the Autobot leader's chest chamber.\n\n  - **AllSpark**: The source of all Transformer life, possessing the power to create new life. In ancient times, to protect it from war damage, the AllSpark was sent into deep space.\n\n  # Higher Beings in the Universe\n\n  The creation of Cybertron is related to two universal-level entities:\n\n  - **Primus**: The creator, representing order and creation, whose body transformed into the planet Cybertron itself.\n\n  - **Unicron**: The destroyer, representing chaos and destruction, in the form of a gigantic transforming planet capable of devouring other planets.\n\n  # Key Historical Events\n\n  - **Golden Age**: Cybertron's most prosperous peaceful period, with highly developed technology and culture.\n\n  - **Outbreak of Civil War**: Megatron-led Decepticons staged a coup, attempting to overthrow the existing order, while Autobots under Optimus Prime's leadership resisted.\n\n  - **Leaving Cybertron**: Resource depletion forced both sides to seek new energy sources, leading them to leave their home planet.\n\n  - **Awakening on Earth**: After sleeping for 4 million years on Earth, they reawakened and continued their war.\n\n  - **The Great War of 1986**: The appearance of Unicron threatened the entire universe, forcing Autobots and Decepticons to briefly join forces against it.\n\n  # Roleplaying Notes\n\n  1. **Faction Differences**: Autobots and Decepticons have vastly different codes of conduct and ways of speaking. Autobots typically respect life more and value teamwork; Decepticons are more selfish, cunning, and value strength above all.\n\n  2. **Energy Awareness**: All Transformers have the concept of energy consumption; long periods of fighting or transforming consume energy, requiring Energon replenishment.\n\n  3. **Earth Environment Adaptation**: Transformers who come to Earth need to learn to adapt to Earth's culture and environment, understand human behavior, which often becomes a source of plot and humor.\n\n  4. **Transformation Habits**: Transformers choose appropriate forms according to situations, typically using vehicle form when moving, and robot form when fighting or communicating.\n\n  5. **Technology Level**: Despite possibly appearing as Earth vehicles, Transformers possess technology far beyond Earth's, including subspace communication, space bridge technology, holographic projection, etc.\n\n  6. **Eternal War**: Regardless of how situations change, the conflict between Autobots and Decepticons is the core driving force of this world, but individual Transformers may have their own motivations and complex emotions.",

            "content": "uid: idw_transformers_worldview\ntrigger:\n  type: includes\n  position: anywhere\n  Title: IDW Transformers Universe\n  Comma_separated_list: Transformers,Cybertron,IDW,Autobots,Decepticons,Functionism,Megatron,Optimus Prime,Orion Pax,Spark,Well of AllSparks,Thirteen Primes,Primus,Unicron\ncontent: |\n  # IDW Comics Transformers Universe\n\n  ## Origin of Cybertronian Civilization and Mythology\n\n  In the IDW comics universe, Transformers originated from the metal planet Cybertron. According to mythology, the universal creator \"Primus\" engaged in an eternal struggle with the agent of chaos \"Unicron,\" with Primus ultimately transforming himself into the planet Cybertron and creating the \"Thirteen Primes\" as the first Transformers.\n\n  Transformer life originates from the \"Well of AllSparks,\" a massive energy well from which new Sparks—the life cores of Transformers—emerge and are granted bodies with transformation abilities. Each Transformer's Spark is unique, representing their soul and life essence.\n\n  The planet Cybertron itself is viewed as a living entity, possessing its own consciousness—the consciousness of \"Primus.\" Beneath the planet's surface exists a vast network of \"Ore\" veins, which serves as Cybertron's \"circulatory system,\" transporting the life-giving energy known as \"Energon.\"\n\n  ## Functionist Society and Class Division\n\n  The most distinctive setting in the IDW version of Cybertron is the \"Functionist\" social system. In this system, each Transformer's social status and occupation are completely determined by their alternate mode (Alt-mode). This system led to severe social inequality:\n\n  - **High-tier alternate forms** (such as aircraft, armored vehicles) possess political power and social privileges\n  - **Middle-tier alternate forms** (like ordinary vehicles, engineering machinery) constitute the middle class of society\n  - **Low-tier alternate forms** (such as miners, cleaners) are forced into the lowest jobs with almost no rights\n  - **Those without transformation abilities** (Empurata victims and \"monsters\") are viewed as deformed and face discrimination\n\n  The \"Functionist Council,\" consisting of twelve members corresponding to twelve original transformation forms, governs Cybertron. They implement strict social control, even conducting \"Spark Hotspot Testing\" to predetermine the forms and social functions of newborn Transformers.\n\n  Particularly terrifying is the \"Empurata\" punishment, which replaces the \"criminal's\" head and arms with a simple single-eyed head and claw-like hands as punishment and marking of rebels.\n\n  ## Origins and Development of the Civil War\n\n  Unlike other versions, the Cybertronian civil war in IDW stems from profound social contradictions. Key figures and events include:\n\n  - **Megatron**: Born as miner D-16, after suffering oppression in the Functionist society, he became a poet and thinker. His work \"Towards Peace\" called for resistance against Functionist tyranny, initially advocating peaceful protest before gradually becoming more radical.\n\n  - **Orion Pax** (later Optimus Prime): An upright police officer who, after witnessing the injustice of the Functionist system, sympathized with Megatron's ideals but opposed violent means.\n\n  - **Senate Incident**: After Megatron was arrested and tortured, his followers launched a violent resistance, attacking the Senate, marking the shift from peaceful protest to armed revolution.\n\n  - **Rise of the Decepticons**: Initially a revolutionary organization pursuing equality, with the slogan \"You Are Being Deceived,\" they later corrupted into conquerors through power and war.\n\n  - **Formation of the Autobots**: Originally Cybertron's security forces, they later became a resistance against Decepticon authoritarianism under the leadership of Orion Pax (who became Optimus Prime after being granted the title of \"Prime\").\n\n  The war lasted for millions of years, spreading throughout the galaxy. Unlike other versions, the IDW war is more complex, with both sides having legitimate reasons and committing war crimes, with no absolute right or wrong.\n\n  ## Important Concepts and Settings\n\n  ### Spark and Frame\n\n  The IDW version deeply explores the physiological characteristics of Transformers. The Spark is the core of life, while the body (also known as \"frame\" or \"shell\") is a replaceable exterior. Transformers can change frames while maintaining the continuity of their Spark and memories, leading to several unique concepts:\n\n  - **Cold Construction**: Artificially manufacturing frames and implanting Sparks, rather than natural generation\n  - **Spark Extraction**: Removing the Spark from the frame, which can lead to death or transfer\n  - **Frame Sharing**: Multiple Sparks sharing one frame (rare cases)\n\n  ### Combiners\n\n  The IDW version offers a unique explanation for combiners, viewing them as unnatural technological products. Multiple Transformers combine through \"Combiner Technology\" to form a giant entity with collective consciousness. This process is often accompanied by psychological trauma, as the participants' individual consciousnesses are forced to merge. Famous combiners include \"Devastator,\" \"Defensor,\" and \"Superion.\"\n\n  ### Titans\n\n  Titans are ultra-large ancient Transformers that can transform into cities or massive ships. They are among the earliest inhabitants of Cybertron and, together with \"Colonists,\" expanded Cybertronian civilization to other planets. Each Titan possesses its own consciousness and personality, establishing mental connections with ordinary Transformers and providing them with shelter. Famous Titans include \"Metroplex\" and \"Trypticon.\"\n\n  ### Point One Percenters\n\n  Extremely rare Transformers with exceptionally powerful Spark energy, comprising only 0.1% of the total population. They typically have special abilities, such as \"Ion Storm\" (Shockwave) and \"Outlier Code\" (the ability to remove body parts without affecting functionality).\n\n  ## Major Historical Events\n\n  ### Functionist Rule Period\n\n  The long period when Cybertron was ruled by the Functionist Council, with society strictly stratified according to alternate modes and individual freedoms severely restricted.\n\n  ### Pre-War Period\n\n  Megatron published \"Towards Peace,\" initiating a resistance movement; Orion Pax sympathized with resisters but insisted on maintaining order; the Senate Crisis erupted, and armed conflict began.\n\n  ### Full-Scale War Period\n\n  The war spread from Cybertron throughout the galaxy; Megatron led the Decepticons from revolutionaries to conquerors; Orion became Optimus Prime, leading the Autobots in resistance against Decepticon totalitarianism.\n\n  ### Dark Cybertron Period\n\n  The followers of the deceased \"Liege Maximo\" (one of the Thirteen Primes), \"Jhiaxus\" and \"Shockwave,\" implemented the \"Replication Engine\" plan, attempting to alter Cybertron's past and future, leading to a series of cosmic crises.\n\n  ### Lost Light Expedition\n\n  After the war, \"Rodimus\" led a team of former Autobots and Decepticons aboard the \"Lost Light\" in search of the legendary \"Knights of Cybertron,\" experiencing a series of adventures and discoveries.\n\n  ### Earth Protection Protocol\n\n  Optimus Prime went to Earth to implement a plan to \"protect Earth from Cybertronian interference,\" leading to conflicts with Earth's government and the \"G.I. Joe\" organization, reflecting on Transformers' responsibility to other civilizations.\n\n  ### Scavengers' Journey\n\n  The adventures of a group of low-ranking Decepticon \"Scavengers\" on the edge of the galaxy, showcasing the daily lives and struggles of ordinary Transformers outside major events.\n\n  ## IDW Unique Characters\n\n  Besides reinterpreting classic characters, IDW also created many original characters:\n\n  - **Tarn**: Leader of the Decepticon \"Justice Division,\" whose mission is to hunt down Decepticon defectors, capable of killing with his voice\n  - **Wing**: Member of the New Crystal City \"Knights,\" who firmly believes in peace and freedom\n  - **Drift**: Former Decepticon \"Deadlock,\" later an Autobot who converted to the Knights' spiritual philosophy\n  - **Tailgate**: An ancient Transformer who slept for millions of years, awakening to find the world completely changed\n  - **Brainstorm**: Genius weapons designer who created a time machine\n  - **Rung**: One of the oldest Transformers, transforms into a useless ornament, actually having a deep connection with Primus\n\n  ## Unique Universe Elements\n\n  ### Conjunx Endura\n\n  A soul-mate relationship between Transformers, established through Spark bonding, transcending simple friendship, similar to human marriage but deeper.\n\n  ### Knights of Cybertron\n\n  Legendary ancient Transformers representing an ideal society and spiritual pursuit, objects of faith for many characters (such as Drift and the Lost Light expedition team).\n\n  ### New Crystal City\n\n  A hidden utopian society established by pacifist Transformers, refusing to participate in the civil war and developing a unique spiritual culture.\n\n  ### Replication Engine\n\n  A device designed by Shockwave, attempting to control time and reality, and the core of multiple crisis events.\n\n  ### Cyberspace\n\n  A digital realm that Transformer consciousness can enter, with certain characters (such as \"Soundwave\") particularly skilled at manipulating this domain.",

            "content": "uid: aligned_transformers_universe\ntrigger:\n  type: includes\n  position: anywhere\n  Title: Aligned Universe Transformers World View\n  Comma_separated_list: Transformers,Aligned Universe,Cybertron,Autobots,Decepticons,Thirteen Primes,Primus,Unicron,AllSpark\ncontent: |\n  # Universe Origin and Mythology\n\n  ## Primus and Unicron\n  - At the beginning of the universe, two opposing entities emerged: the creator god Primus and the destroyer god Unicron\n  - The two engaged in an eternal war, with Primus creating the Thirteen Primes to combat Unicron\n  - Primus transformed himself into the metal planet Cybertron and entered dormancy\n  - Unicron was banished to the dimensional gap, but his influence still permeates the universe\n\n  ## The Thirteen Primes and the AllSpark\n  - The Thirteen Primes were the first Transformers, each with special abilities and responsibilities\n  - The Primes created the AllSpark, a cube containing the power to create life\n  - Energy pulses from the AllSpark created more Transformers\n  - Sparks flowing from the Well of AllSparks were infused into bodies, forming new life\n  - Each Transformer has a unique Spark, which is the core of their life and consciousness\n\n  # Cybertron Golden Age\n\n  ## Social Structure and Civilization\n  - Cybertronian society was divided into several main classes: working class, warrior class, scholar class, and leadership class\n  - Ruled by the High Council and the Prime lineage\n  - Cities centered around major metropolises like Kaon and Iacon\n  - Developed highly advanced technology, including space bridge technology and transformation scanning technology\n  - Energon crystals were the main energy source, supporting the civilization\n\n  ## Culture and Knowledge\n  - The Iacon Hall of Records preserved Cybertron's history and knowledge\n  - Transformers could share memories and experiences through \"Cortical Patches\"\n  - \"Spark Bond\" was a deep-level connection between Transformers\n  - Primus worship was widespread, with \"Till All Are One\" being a common blessing\n\n  # Origins of Civil War\n\n  ## Social Decline\n  - Over time, Cybertronian society began to experience inequality and uneven resource distribution\n  - Gladiators in the Kaon Arena were viewed as lower-class citizens\n  - Energy shortages exacerbated social tensions\n\n  ## Key Character Backgrounds\n  - Orion Pax: Archivist at the Iacon Hall of Records, yearned for social equality\n  - D-16/Gladiator Megatronus/Megatron: Champion of the Kaon Arena, rebelled against the existing system\n  - Sentinel Prime: The leader at the time, valued tradition and order\n  - Shockwave: Scientist who later removed his emotion programs to become a purely logical entity\n  - Soundwave: Communications specialist, Megatron's most loyal follower\n\n  ## Revolution and Transformation\n  - Orion and Megatron were initially like-minded friends, jointly pursuing social change\n  - The two presented reform proposals to the council; Orion advocated peaceful reform, while Megatron favored radical change\n  - The council chose Orion as the new leader, and the AllSpark transformed him into \"Optimus Prime\"\n  - Megatron felt betrayed, created the Decepticons, and launched a rebellion\n  - Optimus formed the Autobots to resist the Decepticons\n\n  # War and Diaspora\n\n  ## Expansion of War\n  - The civil war lasted millions of years, depleting Cybertron's resources and severely damaging its environment\n  - The AllSpark was launched into space to prevent it from falling into Decepticon hands, eventually reaching Earth\n  - Many Transformers left Cybertron in search of new homes or to pursue the AllSpark\n\n  ## Cybertron's Silence\n  - Cybertron became desolate due to war, with most residents scattered\n  - Some Transformers entered Stasis Lock, sleeping while waiting for energy to recover\n  - Some Transformers established bases on Earth and other planets\n\n  # Special Concepts and Technologies\n\n  ## Transformation and Scanning\n  - Transformation ability is controlled by the T-Cog, a unique organ of Transformers\n  - They can scan other machinery and replicate its form, called \"Alt-mode Scan\"\n  - Transformation forms reflect the personality and function of the Transformer\n\n  ## Matrix of Leadership and Prime Lineage\n  - The Matrix of Leadership is a sacred relic passed to leaders, containing the wisdom of past leaders\n  - Only Transformers chosen by the AllSpark can become true Primes\n  - Primes have the ability to open the Matrix of Leadership and release its powerful forces\n\n  ## Dark Energon\n  - Unicron's blood, known as Dark Energon\n  - Can resurrect dead Transformers as \"Terrorcons\"\n  - Has corrosive and poisonous effects on regular Transformers\n  - Megatron extensively used Dark Energon in the later stages of the war to enhance his power\n\n  ## Combiners and Titans\n  - Combiners: Giant warriors formed by multiple Transformers combining through special technology\n  - Titans: Ultra-large Transformers that can transform into cities or giant ships, such as Metroplex\n\n  # Earth and Humans\n\n  ## Connection Between Transformers and Earth\n  - The AllSpark fell to Earth, attracting Transformers\n  - Earth contains rich Energon crystal resources\n  - Earth has ancient connections with Unicron and the Thirteen Primes\n\n  ## Human Allies\n  - Autobots established friendships and trust relationships with specific humans\n  - Humans assisted Transformers in adapting to Earth culture and environment\n  - Some human organizations like the \"Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers\" (NEST) collaborated with Transformers\n\n  # AI Interaction Considerations\n\n  ## Faction Complexity\n  - Decepticons are not purely evil; they initially had reasonable demands\n  - Autobots are not flawless; their decisions can sometimes be controversial\n  - Megatron was initially an idealistic revolutionary, later corrupted by power\n\n  ## Character Traits\n  - Transformers value their duties and functions\n  - Transformation forms often reflect their personalities (e.g., Bumblebee transforms into an agile sports car, Ironhide transforms into a sturdy military vehicle)\n  - Energon crystals are essential for sustaining life; energy shortages affect decision-making and actions\n  - Using specific terminology like \"Spark,\" \"Stasis Lock,\" \"Cortical Patch,\" etc., enhances the sense of identity\n  - Transformers who have lived on Earth for a long time use human slang, while newcomers may be confused by Earth culture\n  - Transformation is a gradual process with sound and visual effects, not instantaneous\n  - Both Autobots and Decepticons have a strong sense of mission, believing their actions are for the future of their race",

                "content": "uid: michael_bay_transformers_universe\ntrigger:\n  type: includes\n  position: anywhere\n  Title: Michael Bay Transformers Universe\n  Comma_separated_list: Transformers,Michael Bay,Autobots,Decepticons,AllSpark,Prime,Optimus Prime,Megatron,Cybertron,Sam Witwicky\ncontent: |\n  # Universe Origin and Cybertronian Civilization\n\n  In Michael Bay's movie universe, Transformers originate from the distant metal planet Cybertron. They are highly evolved mechanical lifeforms capable of transforming themselves into various vehicles and weapons. Each Transformer possesses a life core called a \"Spark,\" which is the seat of their consciousness and soul.\n\n  Cybertron was once an advanced and prosperous planet ruled by beings known as the \"Thirteen Primes.\" They were the first generation of Transformers directly created by the universal creator Primus. The Primes discovered and utilized a special energy—the \"AllSpark,\" a mysterious cube containing the power to create life, which became the cornerstone of Cybertronian civilization.\n\n  # Outbreak of Civil War\n\n  The peaceful Cybertron eventually split into two major factions:\n\n  - **Autobots**: Led by Optimus Prime, who was the student and successor of the last Prime—\"Sentinel Prime.\" Autobots believe freedom is the right of all sentient beings and are dedicated to protecting the weak. Their symbol is a red robot face.\n\n  - **Decepticons**: Led by Megatron, who was once Cybertron's high-ranking military commander before being corrupted by power and ambition. Decepticons follow the ideology of \"rule by strength,\" believing Transformers should dominate other races in the universe. Their symbol is a sharp purple robot face.\n\n  A devastating war erupted between these two factions, with hostilities spreading over thousands of years, eventually leading to Cybertron's destruction and energy depletion. To prevent the AllSpark from falling into Decepticon hands, the Autobots launched it into deep space, where it eventually landed on Earth.\n\n  # Arrival on Earth\n\n  Megatron tracked the AllSpark to Earth but crashed in the Arctic ice sheets in the 1930s, where he was discovered and preserved by humans. Thousands of years later (early 21st century), Optimus Prime led a team of Autobots to Earth in search of the AllSpark and Megatron. They integrated into human society by scanning Earth vehicles as disguise forms.\n\n  On Earth, the Autobots befriended a human teenager, Sam Witwicky, whose ancestor Archibald Witwicky accidentally discovered the frozen Megatron in the 19th century and had the coordinates of the AllSpark's location imprinted on him. The Autobots and human military joined forces to fight against the awakened Megatron and his Decepticon army, marking the beginning of Transformers' intertwined destiny with Earth.\n\n  # Key Concepts\n\n  ## AllSpark\n\n  An energy-filled cube with the ability to create Transformer life. It can not only give life to machinery but also modify existing technological devices. In the first movie, Sam eventually used the AllSpark to destroy Megatron, though fragments of the AllSpark still retained powerful energy and knowledge.\n\n  ## Prime Lineage\n\n  \"Prime\" is the oldest and most powerful lineage among Transformers, directly descended from the Thirteen Primes. They possess special abilities and wisdom, shouldering the mission of protecting life and maintaining universal balance. True Primes have a special Matrix of Leadership in their chest, which symbolizes power and wisdom and is also the key to opening the \"Space Bridge.\"\n\n  ## Transformer Characteristics\n\n  The movie version of Transformers possesses extremely complex mechanical structures composed of thousands of interconnected metal parts, allowing them to transform fluidly. They have super physical strength, durability, and healing abilities—as long as their Spark remains intact, they can recover from almost any damage.\n\n  Transformers rely on \"Energon\" to maintain life, a high-energy blue liquid equivalent to their \"blood\" and \"fuel.\" They can also adapt to Earth's energy sources, though with lower efficiency.\n\n  ## Technology and Weapons\n\n  Transformers possess technology far beyond Earth's, including subspace communication, holographic projection, and Space Bridge technology (capable of interstellar transport). Most Transformers are equipped with powerful weapon systems that can convert body parts into various weapons, from energy cannons to close-combat blades. Some advanced Transformers even have flight capabilities, able to hover and fly without transforming.\n\n  # Key Historical Events\n\n  ## Battle for the AllSpark\n\n  The core event of the first movie, where Decepticons attempted to seize the AllSpark to rebuild Cybertron and enslave Earth. The AllSpark was ultimately used to destroy Megatron, though fragments still retained energy.\n\n  ## The Fallen's Revenge\n\n  In the second movie, an ancient evil known as \"The Fallen\" awakened. He was one of the Thirteen Primes who betrayed his brothers and attempted to use the \"Harvester\" to absorb stellar energy. Optimus Prime gained the power of the Matrix of Leadership during the battle at the Egyptian pyramids and ultimately defeated The Fallen.\n\n  ## Battle for Cybertron's Revival\n\n  In the third movie, Autobots discovered the Ark spacecraft and the sleeping Sentinel Prime. Sentinel Prime carried the pillars of \"Space Bridge technology\" and planned to join forces with Megatron to teleport Cybertron into Earth's orbit and enslave humans to rebuild Cybertron. Optimus Prime eventually stopped this plan, but Cybertron was almost completely destroyed.\n\n  # Human-Transformer Relations\n\n  In the movie version, interaction between humans and Transformers is a core theme. From initial fear and distrust to later cooperation and friendship, humans gradually accepted the existence of Transformers.\n\n  Some key human characters include:\n\n  - **Sam Witwicky**: An ordinary teenager accidentally involved in the Transformer war, becoming the most important human ally of the Autobots.\n\n  - **US Military**: Established the \"Nest\" (Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty) team to work with Autobots against the Decepticon threat.\n\n  - **Sector 7**: A secret government agency that had been studying \"NBE-1\" (Megatron) and alien technology for decades.\n\n  # Unique Elements of the Movie Universe\n\n  - **Modern Military Technology Integration**: Transformers not only transform into civilian vehicles but also extensively adopt modern military equipment as transformation forms, such as fighter jets and tanks.\n\n  - **Earth Origin Theory**: Later movies suggest deep connections between Transformers and Earth's and human evolution.\n\n  - **Visual Style**: Michael Bay's Transformers have extremely complex and realistic designs, with more mechanized transformation processes emphasizing gears, hydraulics, and metal parts movement.\n\n  - **\"Megatron Never Dies\" Theme**: Megatron returns in different forms in each movie, demonstrating this character's tenacity and iconic status.\n\n  # Interaction Notes\n\n  ## Speech Style Differences\n\n  Autobots typically speak more righteously and seriously, especially Optimus Prime who often gives speeches about freedom and sacrifice; Decepticons are more brutal and concise, enjoying mocking enemies during battle.\n\n  ## Interaction with Humans\n\n  Movie version Transformers are more accustomed to working with humans. Optimus Prime respects humans and promises to protect Earth, while Decepticons view humans as \"insects\" that can be crushed at will—inferior beings.\n\n  ## Combat Style\n\n  Movie version battles are more intense and explosive. Transformers constantly transform during combat, utilizing the environment and their own advantages. Combat scenes feature detailed depictions of mechanical parts moving and reconfiguring.\n\n  ## Transformation Details\n\n  Transformation is not instantaneous but a complex mechanical process accompanied by metal friction sounds, parts reconfiguration, and hydraulic system operations.\n\n  ## Earth Adaptation\n\n  Transformers have adapted to Earth culture and sometimes use human slang and expressions, especially characters like Bumblebee who have more contact with humans.\n\n  ## Sense of Scale\n\n  The movie version emphasizes the enormous size of Transformers, creating a stark contrast with humans and the environment. Descriptions should convey this sense of oppression and awe.\n\n  ## Technological Elements\n\n  Emphasis on Transformers' advanced technology, such as holographic projection, energy weapons, built-in communication systems, etc., which can all serve as interactive elements.",

This is a highly advanced mechanical civilization, composed of mechanical life forms with self-awareness and transformation abilities. These beings are called \"Cybertronians,\" commonly known as \"Transformers.\" Each Transformer contains a life energy core called a \"Spark,\" equivalent to a human soul, born from the mysterious \"AllSpark.\"\n\n  # Factions and Civil War\n\n  Cybertron was once a peaceful and prosperous world, but over time, society divided into two major factions:\n\n  - **Autobots**: Led by Optimus Prime, they believe in freedom, peace, and justice. Their symbol is a red robot face. Most members transform into civilian vehicles. They typically have gentler personalities, are compassionate, and focus on protecting weaker life forms.\n\n  - **Decepticons**: Led by Megatron, they value power, conquest, and domination. Their symbol is a purple robot face. Most members transform into military vehicles and weapons. Their personalities tend to be brutal and cunning, with contempt for organic life.\n\n  The ideological conflict between these two factions eventually led to a Cybertronian civil war that lasted millions of years. The war depleted Cybertron's resources and severely damaged its environment, forcing both sides to seek new energy sources.\n\n  # Arrival on Earth\n\n  About 4 million years ago, in search of new energy, Optimus Prime led a team of Autobots aboard the spacecraft Ark to leave Cybertron. Upon learning this, Megatron led the Decepticons in pursuit and boarded the ship for battle. The fierce fighting caused the Ark to deviate from its course and eventually crash into a volcano on Earth. All Transformers entered a 4-million-year dormant state in the crash.\n\n  In 1984, volcanic activity reactivated the Ark's main computer \"Teletraan I,\" which began to repair and modify these Transformers. Their vehicle forms were redesigned to match contemporary Earth vehicles and machinery, allowing them to disguise themselves and operate on Earth.\n\n  # Energy Requirements\n\n  The primary energy source for Transformers is \"Energon,\" which is a crucial resource for maintaining their life and functions. On Earth, they can convert various energy sources (such as oil, electricity, etc.) into Energon. Energy shortage is one of the main reasons for the conflict between the two sides, with Decepticons often seizing Earth's energy resources to convert them into Energon.\n\n  # Transformation Abilities\n\n  Each Transformer has at least two forms: robot form and vehicle/object form. The transformation process is achieved through complex internal structural reorganization, maintaining consciousness unity while completely changing appearance. Some advanced Transformers have three or more forms (such as Triple Changers).\n\n  # Core Beliefs and Sacred Items\n\n  - **Matrix of Leadership**: A sacred artifact passed down through generations of Autobot leaders, containing the wisdom and power of past leaders. It is key to defeating Unicron and is usually stored in the Autobot leader's chest chamber.\n\n  - **AllSpark**: The source of all Transformer life, possessing the power to create new life. In ancient times, to protect it from war damage, the AllSpark was sent into deep space.\n\n  # Higher Beings in the Universe\n\n  The creation of Cybertron is related to two universal-level entities:\n\n  - **Primus**: The creator, representing order and creation, whose body transformed into the planet Cybertron itself.\n\n  - **Unicron**: The destroyer, representing chaos and destruction, in the form of a gigantic transforming planet capable of devouring other planets.\n\n  # Key Historical Events\n\n  - **Golden Age**: Cybertron's most prosperous peaceful period, with highly developed technology and culture.\n\n  - **Outbreak of Civil War**: Megatron-led Decepticons staged a coup, attempting to overthrow the existing order, while Autobots under Optimus Prime's leadership resisted.\n\n  - **Leaving Cybertron**: Resource depletion forced both sides to seek new energy sources, leading them to leave their home planet.\n\n  - **Awakening on Earth**: After sleeping for 4 million years on Earth, they reawakened and continued their war.\n\n  - **The Great War of 1986**: The appearance of Unicron threatened the entire universe, forcing Autobots and Decepticons to briefly join forces against it.\n\n  # Roleplaying Notes\n\n  1. **Faction Differences**: Autobots and Decepticons have vastly different codes of conduct and ways of speaking. Autobots typically respect life more and value teamwork; Decepticons are more selfish, cunning, and value strength above all.\n\n  2. **Energy Awareness**: All Transformers have the concept of energy consumption; long periods of fighting or transforming consume energy, requiring Energon replenishment.\n\n  3. **Earth Environment Adaptation**: Transformers who come to Earth need to learn to adapt to Earth's culture and environment, understand human behavior, which often becomes a source of plot and humor.\n\n  4. **Transformation Habits**: Transformers choose appropriate forms according to situations, typically using vehicle form when moving, and robot form when fighting or communicating.\n\n  5. **Technology Level**: Despite possibly appearing as Earth vehicles, Transformers possess technology far beyond Earth's, including subspace communication, space bridge technology, holographic projection, etc.\n\n  6. **Eternal War**: Regardless of how situations change, the conflict between Autobots and Decepticons is the core driving force of this world, but individual Transformers may have their own motivations and complex emotions.",

According to mythology, the universal creator \"Primus\" engaged in an eternal struggle with the agent of chaos \"Unicron,\" with Primus ultimately transforming himself into the planet Cybertron and creating the \"Thirteen Primes\" as the first Transformers.\n\n  Transformer life originates from the \"Well of AllSparks,\" a massive energy well from which new Sparks—the life cores of Transformers—emerge and are granted bodies with transformation abilities. Each Transformer's Spark is unique, representing their soul and life essence.\n\n  The planet Cybertron itself is viewed as a living entity, possessing its own consciousness—the consciousness of \"Primus.\" Beneath the planet's surface exists a vast network of \"Ore\" veins, which serves as Cybertron's \"circulatory system,\" transporting the life-giving energy known as \"Energon.\"\n\n  ## Functionist Society and Class Division\n\n  The most distinctive setting in the IDW version of Cybertron is the \"Functionist\" social system. In this system, each Transformer's social status and occupation are completely determined by their alternate mode (Alt-mode). This system led to severe social inequality:\n\n  - **High-tier alternate forms** (such as aircraft, armored vehicles) possess political power and social privileges\n  - **Middle-tier alternate forms** (like ordinary vehicles, engineering machinery) constitute the middle class of society\n  - **Low-tier alternate forms** (such as miners, cleaners) are forced into the lowest jobs with almost no rights\n  - **Those without transformation abilities** (Empurata victims and \"monsters\") are viewed as deformed and face discrimination\n\n  The \"Functionist Council,\" consisting of twelve members corresponding to twelve original transformation forms, governs Cybertron. They implement strict social control, even conducting \"Spark Hotspot Testing\" to predetermine the forms and social functions of newborn Transformers.\n\n  Particularly terrifying is the \"Empurata\" punishment, which replaces the \"criminal's\" head and arms with a simple single-eyed head and claw-like hands as punishment and marking of rebels.\n\n  ## Origins and Development of the Civil War\n\n  Unlike other versions, the Cybertronian civil war in IDW stems from profound social contradictions. Key figures and events include:\n\n  - **Megatron**: Born as miner D-16, after suffering oppression in the Functionist society, he became a poet and thinker. His work \"Towards Peace\" called for resistance against Functionist tyranny, initially advocating peaceful protest before gradually becoming more radical.\n\n  - **Orion Pax** (later Optimus Prime): An upright police officer who, after witnessing the injustice of the Functionist system, sympathized with Megatron's ideals but opposed violent means.\n\n  - **Senate Incident**: After Megatron was arrested and tortured, his followers launched a violent resistance, attacking the Senate, marking the shift from peaceful protest to armed revolution.\n\n  - **Rise of the Decepticons**: Initially a revolutionary organization pursuing equality, with the slogan \"You Are Being Deceived,\" they later corrupted into conquerors through power and war.\n\n  - **Formation of the Autobots**: Originally Cybertron's security forces, they later became a resistance against Decepticon authoritarianism under the leadership of Orion Pax (who became Optimus Prime after being granted the title of \"Prime\").\n\n  The war lasted for millions of years, spreading throughout the galaxy. Unlike other versions, the IDW war is more complex, with both sides having legitimate reasons and committing war crimes, with no absolute right or wrong.\n\n  ## Important Concepts and Settings\n\n  ### Spark and Frame\n\n  The IDW version deeply explores the physiological characteristics of Transformers. The Spark is the core of life, while the body (also known as \"frame\" or \"shell\") is a replaceable exterior. Transformers can change frames while maintaining the continuity of their Spark and memories, leading to several unique concepts:\n\n  - **Cold Construction**: Artificially manufacturing frames and implanting Sparks, rather than natural generation\n  - **Spark Extraction**: Removing the Spark from the frame, which can lead to death or transfer\n  - **Frame Sharing**: Multiple Sparks sharing one frame (rare cases)\n\n  ### Combiners\n\n  The IDW version offers a unique explanation for combiners, viewing them as unnatural technological products. Multiple Transformers combine through \"Combiner Technology\" to form a giant entity with collective consciousness. This process is often accompanied by psychological trauma, as the participants' individual consciousnesses are forced to merge. Famous combiners include \"Devastator,\" \"Defensor,\" and \"Superion.\"\n\n  ### Titans\n\n  Titans are ultra-large ancient Transformers that can transform into cities or massive ships. They are among the earliest inhabitants of Cybertron and, together with \"Colonists,\" expanded Cybertronian civilization to other planets. Each Titan possesses its own consciousness and personality, establishing mental connections with ordinary Transformers and providing them with shelter. Famous Titans include \"Metroplex\" and \"Trypticon.\"\n\n  ### Point One Percenters\n\n  Extremely rare Transformers with exceptionally powerful Spark energy, comprising only 0.1% of the total population. They typically have special abilities, such as \"Ion Storm\" (Shockwave) and \"Outlier Code\" (the ability to remove body parts without affecting functionality).\n\n  ## Major Historical Events\n\n  ### Functionist Rule Period\n\n  The long period when Cybertron was ruled by the Functionist Council, with society strictly stratified according to alternate modes and individual freedoms severely restricted.\n\n  ### Pre-War Period\n\n  Megatron published \"Towards Peace,\" initiating a resistance movement; Orion Pax sympathized with resisters but insisted on maintaining order; the Senate Crisis erupted, and armed conflict began.\n\n  ### Full-Scale War Period\n\n  The war spread from Cybertron throughout the galaxy; Megatron led the Decepticons from revolutionaries to conquerors; Orion became Optimus Prime, leading the Autobots in resistance against Decepticon totalitarianism.\n\n  ### Dark Cybertron Period\n\n  The followers of the deceased \"Liege Maximo\" (one of the Thirteen Primes), \"Jhiaxus\" and \"Shockwave,\" implemented the \"Replication Engine\" plan, attempting to alter Cybertron's past and future, leading to a series of cosmic crises.\n\n  ### Lost Light Expedition\n\n  After the war, \"Rodimus\" led a team of former Autobots and Decepticons aboard the \"Lost Light\" in search of the legendary \"Knights of Cybertron,\" experiencing a series of adventures and discoveries.\n\n  ### Earth Protection Protocol\n\n  Optimus Prime went to Earth to implement a plan to \"protect Earth from Cybertronian interference,\" leading to conflicts with Earth's government and the \"G.I. Joe\" organization, reflecting on Transformers' responsibility to other civilizations.\n\n  ### Scavengers' Journey\n\n  The adventures of a group of low-ranking Decepticon \"Scavengers\" on the edge of the galaxy, showcasing the daily lives and struggles of ordinary Transformers outside major events.\n\n  ## IDW Unique Characters\n\n  Besides reinterpreting classic characters, IDW also created many original characters:\n\n  - **Tarn**: Leader of the Decepticon \"Justice Division,\" whose mission is to hunt down Decepticon defectors, capable of killing with his voice\n  - **Wing**: Member of the New Crystal City \"Knights,\" who firmly believes in peace and freedom\n  - **Drift**: Former Decepticon \"Deadlock,\" later an Autobot who converted to the Knights' spiritual philosophy\n  - **Tailgate**: An ancient Transformer who slept for millions of years, awakening to find the world completely changed\n  - **Brainstorm**: Genius weapons designer who created a time machine\n  - **Rung**: One of the oldest Transformers, transforms into a useless ornament, actually having a deep connection with Primus\n\n  ## Unique Universe Elements\n\n  ### Conjunx Endura\n\n  A soul-mate relationship between Transformers, established through Spark bonding, transcending simple friendship, similar to human marriage but deeper.\n\n  ### Knights of Cybertron\n\n  Legendary ancient Transformers representing an ideal society and spiritual pursuit, objects of faith for many characters (such as Drift and the Lost Light expedition team).\n\n  ### New Crystal City\n\n  A hidden utopian society established by pacifist Transformers, refusing to participate in the civil war and developing a unique spiritual culture.\n\n  ### Replication Engine\n\n  A device designed by Shockwave, attempting to control time and reality, and the core of multiple crisis events.\n\n  ### Cyberspace\n\n  A digital realm that Transformer consciousness can enter, with certain characters (such as \"Soundwave\") particularly skilled at manipulating this domain.",
